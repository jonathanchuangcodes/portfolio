SoundCloud, one of the world's most popular music streaming platforms, has accrued mainstream media fame for launching professional musics careers of up-and-coming artists on the platform with a number of viral hits.

These hits are really a result of the great Listener/Creator dichotomy SoundCloud possesses on their platform.

Listeners can discover new music and artists unique to the platform alongside popular and mainstream content.

Creators can easily upload, share, and promote their music on a large platform, allowing amateur, aspiring artists to get noticed.

This novel approach to drive content consumption and creation is unfortunately paired with a design that needs improvements.

Visual design issues are few and far between, but the inconsistent information architecture that forms the backbone of SoundCloud's
user experience is a detriment to an otherwise stellar platform.

# A Job Well Done

A few aspects that are done well.

## A Solid Bottom Up Architecture

SoundCloud has solid foundational information architecture, with a comprehensive bottom-up architecture that allows user
to easily understand and establish connections between their content.

Fundamentally, a bottom up architecture strives for **every page to be page one**.

In SoundCloud's case, each type of content (track/album/playlist/etc.) that SoundCloud has displays its own unique page that functions independently.
For each type of content, you can see how the page's contents follow a specific pattern.

### 1. Song/Track Page

Each track page has a unique waveform display, allowing users to comment on timestamps. There is also a unique description provided under this waveform and comment system.

    {
      title: "songpage.png",
      caption: "Song/Track Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

### 2. Album/Playlist Page

Each playlist or album page includes information like the number of tracks, the total time, and a unique tracklist.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "albumpage.png",
      caption: "Album/Playlist Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

The album art, genre tags, and recommendations section remain consistent on these pages.

Information shows up exactly the same way, even if the content on the page is different.

Any piece of information a page displays that can be connected to another piece of content is linked.

Clicking on the artist name will take you to the SoundCloud page for that artist.

This interconnection applies to other pieces of information on a page, like an individual track, artist (in a number of contexts, like in a playlist) and tag..

## A Solid Top-Down Architecture

Top down architecture starts at a website's primary navigation, and SoundCloud's primary navigation is built for understanding, and driven by user needs.

### Global Navigation

1. The Home page gives users instant access to all of the trending content on SoundCloud, as well as other discovery focused, personalized content like
   "Artists you should know", "Future Sounds", "New Arrivals", and many more.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "homepage.png",
      caption: "Home Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

2. The Stream page gives users access to all of the content that they are following, allowing them to keep track of any new releases from their favorite artists on SoundCloud.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "streampage.png",
      caption: "Stream Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

3. The Library page gives users instant access to any content that they have saved/liked, including tracks, albums, and playlists among many others.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "librarypage.png",
      caption: "Library Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

These 3 pages all exemplify SoundCloud's understanding of their user's needs.

Using a music discovery page as their homepage puts the unique value of SoundCloud's platform at the forefront of their user experience.

In contrast the Stream and Library pages put the focus on content users are already familiar with, with each enabling the user to explore this content in a different way.

These pages compliment one another, putting focus on two critical needs for music listeners:

1. The ability to discover new music
2. The ability to listen to music they already enjoy in a personalized setting

### Local Navigation

There is only one instance of local navigation on SoundCloud found in the Library page. The content that users can choose to save to their library like tracks,
playlists and albums require distinctions that are enabled with the local navigation.

There is even an Overview page in a user's library, where content that was most recently played or liked by the user are displayed.

# Needs Improvement

A few architectural elements that need improving

### Labeling

SoundCloud makes good choices in terms of the pages they choose to show in their navigations, but they make some strange and misleading choices in terms of their labeling.

One example of this poor labeling is on their website's global navigation; the Stream tab.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "globalnav.png",
      caption: "Global Navigation",
    },
  ]}
/>

This label choice seems poor as it is vague, and gives little indication as to what kind of content a user should be expecting on that page.

**The Stream page actually consists of musical content from a user's followed artists.**

Therefore some more suitable choices could be "My Artists" or "My Follows" for example that indicate personalized user content on that page.

---

Another example of poor labeling is shown here at the local navigation of the Library page.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "localnav.png",
      caption: "Local Navigation",
    },
  ]}
/>

Specifically, SoundCloud chose to label the second tab as "Likes". This label is not inaccurate, but it is too broad.
This page only contains **tracks** that a user may have liked, but other content such as albums and playlists can also be liked by a user.

In fact **ALL** content on the Library page is liked by the user. Therefore a more appropriate heading could simply be "Tracks".

## Summary

All in all, SoundCloudâ€™s information architecture is robust and well-designed, despite a few shortcomings.

It has a good understanding of its user base and the structure of their IA is aligned with this understanding.

With a few improvements, users can feel more confident about finding the content they want quickly and easily.

> We took some time to showcase some of the improvements we made into a short prototype that can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e31902e5-d73f-4ba2-4f43-ade2e29e27f9-9528/?fullscreen).
