## Problem Statement

Putting together a portfolio is hard work. Even if every project you've ever worked
on is a masterpiece, it doesn't mean that those projects are well suited for your desired
line of work. Pursuing your own projects to add to your portfolio is arguably
even more difficult; just choosing a good project idea is a headache of its own.

These difficulties weighed heavily on my teams mind as we considered ideas to pursue
for this design studio course. As a result, our team came up with the idea for
a platform that would facilitate aspiring designers/developers/project managers
to advance their skills and careers by giving them projects to work on directly
on the platform.

Here's a sneak peak of our final product landing page to really get our idea across.

Once a user completed a project, they could display their work directly on the platform.
The project specifications themselves would be created in collaboration with companies
looking to hire. This model would allow for aspiring job candidates to showcase their
skills and capabilities whilst allowing companies to handpick the type of skills they
want to see in a potential candidate.

## The Design Process

Our idea gained traction with our stakeholders (in this case our professor and our peers)
but we needed to gain a better understanding of what our user flow and potential
users would look like.

We created the customer journey maps and storyboards you see below to showcase this
understanding.

<LightboxImage

    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 1",
    },
    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap2.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 2",
    },
    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap3.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 3",
    },
    {
      title: "storyboard.jpg",
      caption: "Storyboard",
    },
  ]}
/>

We then created 2 core user personas to further showcase our potential users and what they would look like.
We wanted to get an understanding of the specific pain points our users were facing to establish an
idea of how our platform would be addressing these difficulties.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "Joe.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Joe (Part 1)",
    },
    {
      title: "Joe2.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Joe (Part 2)",
    },
    {
      title: "Sandy.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Sandy (Part 2)",
    },
    {
      title: "Sandy2.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Sandy (Part 2)",
    },
  ]}
/>

Then to further confirm our audience definition, we created and distributed a customer
survey and performed user interviews. We asked them questions concerning their struggles
showcasing their skills and abilities to potential employers, what kind of work
they were willing to do to showcase these skills, and other concerns they had in
regards to the job hunting process.

    {

      caption: "Likeliness to Use vs. Currently Seeking a Job Bar Chart",
    },
    {
      title: "jobsecurityconcernvsuse.png",
      caption:
        "Correlation Between Job Security Concern and Likelines to Use Bar Chart",
    },
    {
      title: "usevstimeseekingjob.png",
      caption:
        "Likeliness to Use vs Amount of Time Looking for Jobs Line Graph",
    },
    {
      title: "unpaidvsneed.png",
      caption:
        "Willingness to do Unpaid Portfolio Work vs. Need for Portfolio Work Chart",
    },
  ]}
/>

We also created some low-fidelity wireframes of our platform to do some basic user testing
with potential users to see how our user flow would perform in action.

<LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "lofi_Browse_projects.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Browse Projects Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Select_Companies.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Companies Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Select_Professions.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Professions Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Difficulty.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Difficulty Page",
    },
  ]}
/>

After some refinements based on stakeholder feedback, we began working on a higher fidelity
version of our wireframes for user testing, and eventually ended up with a final prototype.

To see a clickable prototype of this web platform, click [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4TBW3F5RK#/screens)

This prototype is meant to walk the users through the entire core product experience,
from the discovery of the platform for the user to finally submitting a project.

We sent this prototype alongside specific instructions for testers to usertesting.com,
a platform that gives users access to a large pool of testing candidates to test
out prototypes and products with.

We scoped down our pool of users to our target audience of young professionals looking
to or have only recently started their careers, and had these 10 users test out our prototype.

Our prototype performed very well, establishing quickly the user's understanding of
the product, with few hiccups as users navigated through our core use case of starting
and completing a project.

This is backed up by 2 key metrics provided by our follow up questionnaire:

<div className="scores">
  <div>
    <p>Likeliness to Use </p>
    <h3> 8.4 </h3>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Likeliness to Recommend </p>
    <h3> 8.6 </h3>
  </div>
</div>

Other positive user feedback included:

<div className="feedback">
  <p>Aesthetically pleasing design</p>
  <p>Quick and easy understanding of the product from the landing page alone</p>
  <p>Overall intrigue and excitement about the product idea</p>
</div>

Here's a sneak peak of our final designs. For a more thorough experience,
