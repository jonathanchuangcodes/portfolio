[Dashboard.football](https://www.dashboard.football/) is a dashboard web application that will allows users to keep track of
multiple soccer competitions that they follow in one place.

You can view the original source code for this project on my github [here](https://github.com/jonathanchuangcodes/football).

# Inspiration

This project was an opportunity for me to learn how to create a standalone modern React web application. I wanted to showcase
my knowledge of a number of web development concepts while creating a product that I'm passionate about that I had a lot of background
knowledge for.

### What I am learning from this project

- React Functional components
- React Hooks
- Writing Custom Hooks
- Redux State Management
- User authentication with Firebase
- CSS in JSS with Material UI's Emotion

## An Avid Football âš½ Fan's Testimony

I'm a self proclaimed football fan, following all of the top leagues in Europe with at
minimum passing interest. Point to any player on the TV screen and I could probably give you an informed opinion of that player.

But following the sport that I'm so passionate about has been a surprising struggle.

## A World of Frustrating Solutions ðŸ¤¦

For all of the solutions that I tried and interacted with, not one ever seemed to stick.

I signed up for countless sports score/sports content websites that were intended to fulfill this need, but would always leave dissatisfied. They
had some sort of drawback that prevented me from fully adopting them.

# Competitive Analysis

To gather a more complete picture of why these solutions weren't working, I gathered screenshots and analyzed the top websites that would come up when
someone searches "soccer scores" on Google, breaking down what each solution did well and why they might fall short of being adopted by a user like me.

The Notion of my complete analysis notes can be found [here](https://draconia.notion.site/6aa100f974804544af28f9ab1400473f?v=f600cfb8bbd64ad7943315e77b6707e9).

After synthesizing this analysis I found 3 key factors that were preventing adoption of their platform.

---

## 1. Lack of Personalization

None of the solutions I tried had an onboarding experience that asked me what I was interested in following, which seemed odd considering how different
each users interest could be when following sports.

Platforms would simply show all the available information at once, with some having limited personalization features like
a Favorites section.

LiveScore.com for example has a dedicated Favorites section, but its limited to individual matches and competitions. But favoriting doesn't really increase
usability. It simply provides quick links to the same content as if you had searched up the league or match in the search function.

Soccer24 has a Favorites feature too but only for Teams and Leagues.

![Soccer24 Home page](assets/soccer24_home.png)

All in all, personalization was lackluster at best.

## 2. Too much Content Pushing Leads to Cognitive Load

The websites hoping to cater to all sports fans like Fox Sports and ESPN do this consistently more than the others, understandably so. They're hoping that
since you might be a general sports fan, you might be interested in any and all sports content, so they show users flashy and big content cards like the ones on the
Fox Sports home page, hoping to grab you're attention.

![Fox Sports Home page](assets/fox_home.png)

Even if you **explicitly** choose the Premier League âš½ as your favorite competition, you might assume that only content relevant to this competition would be shown,
but thats not the case. The website still show you content for sports you don't follow.

This choice always puzzled me. The platform explicitly asks for the user's preference, but then chooses to ignore them the majority of the time.

Websites dedicated to âš½ scores and âš½ content only are better with this for obvious reasons, but they also tend to shove too much information and content
onto the page.

Sites like LiveScore and Soccer24 do a decent job of prioritizing user favorited content, but still shows information for leagues the user may not be interested
in, often times too much of it too.

![Soccer24 Bottom off Home Page](assets/soccer24_bottom_home.png)

Their home pages end up scrolling really far down as they show you every match for every league that day. It seems like a poor use of space on the page to put every
score for every league possible into one long table on the page.

},
{

caption: "Soccer24 Home page",
},
]}*/}

### Where's the information I actually want?

Some examples of what one might consistently expect to see might be the upcoming matches for your favorites and the latest results for your favorites,
which you will find only appears sometimes depending on the website.

ESPN's home shows you upcoming matches, but no recent match results.

![ESPN Home page](assets/espn_home.png)

Fox Sports home shows the exact opposite; recent match recents, but no upcoming match details.

## 3. Clunky UI and UX

Aesthetically the Fox Sports website and Livescore website seem the most up to date with current trends, emphasizing a minimal design language with ample padding
and white space, but usability is hampered by lackluster personalization options.

{/*<LightboxImage

{

},
{
title: "livescore_home.png",
caption: "LiveScore Home page",
},
]}
/>*/}

Other websites like WhoScored and Soccer24 offer a wealth of impressive information, but oudated, bloated UIs and a confusing content organization make the websites less approachable.

# A Vision of a one stop Dashboard

Unsatisfied with the current existing solutions, I set out ambitiously to build my own. To avoid the pitfuls of these solutions, I started writing down some guiding principles
to aid me along the process. They will help me maintain focus and ensure I actually solve for the issues I encountered previously.

## 1. Uncompromising Personalization

- Whether its the 3rd tier of the Belgium football league or the ever popular British Premier League, users should be able to see information about these matches in one place.
- Users should be able to follow and unfollow their favorite competitions and teams with ease.

## 2. Content only when Appropriate

- A true home page should include content from a user's favorites and **only** their favorites.
- If I'm on a page for a specific league, I should only see news content for that league.

> **I will know that my solution is successful when these guiding principles are met. They will also continue to evolve and mature as I interate through designs and production builds.**

# Milestone 1

The research and competitive analysis I performed indicated that football fans follow the sport from 3 key perspectives; they follow their favorite teams,
competitions, and players, not necessarily in that order.

## Creating an initial Design

My initial design therefore categorized information that a user follows based on these 3 types. Users would be able to expand and minimize each section
based on what they wanted to see. Upcoming and Live match information would be shown at the top as cards, if available.

![Home Page Version 1](assets/homepagev1.png)

## Exploring the API

I then created an initial version of the competitions page for leagues and cups. This would be one of the most popular pages of my application, so I decided to start production
of this page as an initial MVP where users can see match and standings information. This allowed me to test out the data API I'm working with, [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/)
and acertain any development limitations.

},
]}
/>*/}

# Milestone 2

After familiarizing myself a bit with the API and what I could achieve, I decided to write down some goals I wanted to achieve for
the next version of dashboard.football:

1. Categorize the application based on teams and competitions.

Because of data limitations of the API, I decided that focusing on teams and competitions as the primary categories
in the application made more sense. The API simply did not have enough individual player information that would make a dedicated
players page a useful source.

2. Make it easy for users to search and add teams and competitions to the dashboard.

Milestone 1's implementation was hardcoded, with only a select few competitions being shown out of the +900 leagues & cup competitions available.
A search and add functionality would achieve the basic personalization the application's philosophy calls for.

3. Create an onboarding experience.

A basic onboarding experience would guide users through the sign up and personalization process so that the users can understand how the application
works and start using the dashboard quickly.

4. Allow users to sign up for an account so that personalization settings like their followed teams and competitions could be saved.

Having unique user accounts early is key to the philosophy of dashboard.football as more personalized features will be added. This ensures that
any previous choices a user makes are saved as the application updates. They'll also be about to sign into dashboard.football on any device with
their credentials and load in their personalized settings.

## Sitemap

Based on these goals and what I learned from the application, I created a simple sitemap to visualize and understand the basic flow of the application.

{/*<LightboxImage
images={[
{
title: "footballdashboardsitemap.png",
caption: "Milstone 2 Sitemap",
},
]}
/>*/}

## Designs

I made some new mockups in Figma following the sitemap, creating a custom header component with a home button for a page showing
all teams and competitions the user follows, link buttons that navigate to individual team and competition pages, and a login/signup link.
Next to the link buttons for teams and competitions are add buttons that will show a modal when clicked that allow users to quickly add
a new team or competition to follow.

{/*<LightboxImage
images={[
{
title: "homepagev2.png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Home Page",
},
]}
/>*/}

The teams and competitions pages look very similar, but also include some competition and team specific information like a league leaderboard and
a current squad component.

{/*<LightboxImage
images={[
{
title: "teampagev2.png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Team Page",
},
{
title: "competitionpagev2.png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Competition Page",
},
]}
/>*/}

The onboarding process I chose to design for was email authentication, a more modern, lightweight method of sign in that forces the user to verify their email to sign in,
but doesn't require them to remember or make a password.

{/*<LightboxImage
images={[
{
title: "onboarding(SignInEmail).png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Onboarding Page: email not entered",
},
{
title: "onboarding(SignInEmailEntered).png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Onboarding Page: email entered",
},
{
title: "onboarding(VerificationLinkSent).png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Onboarding Page: verification link sent",
},
]}
/>*/}

Finally I create a simple 2-step personalization process that asks users to choose the teams and competitions they want to follow.

{/*<LightboxImage
images={[
{
title: "onboarding(ChooseTeams).png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Onboarding Page: choose teams",
},
{
title: "onboarding(ChooseCompetitions).png",
caption: "Milestone 2 Onboarding Page: choose competitions",
},
]}
/>*/}
