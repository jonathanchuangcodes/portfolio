# Football Dashboard: Beta Version (Ongoing)

After creating a first version of the [Football Dashboard](/football-dashboard-alpha) last year, I've been slowly working on a new and improved iteration.

The main goals for this version are to:

1. Streamline data fetching and bring it to to server side, with the help of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
2. Improve the UI and UX, with the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
3. Add more features, such as player stats and team stats.
4. Utilize Typescript to improve code quality and developer experience.

This is an ongoing project and I will be updating this page as I make progress.
