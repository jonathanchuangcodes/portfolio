# Football Dashboard: Beta Version (Ongoing)
After creating a first version of the [Football Dashboard](/works/football-dashboard-alpha) last year, I've been slowly working on a new and improved iteration.
The main goals for this version are to:

1. Streamline data fetching and bring it to to server side, with the help of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
2. Improve the UI and UX, with the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
3. Add more features, such as player stats and team stats.
4. Utilize Typescript to improve code quality and developer experience.

## Success Criteria

1. A responsive, mobile first Next.js application that reliably provides up to date match scores, statistics, and highlights(from youtube) of football matches from the top 10 most popular leagues.
2. Email authentication for account data management stored on Supabase that saves the user’s selected favorites
3. live match updates with desktop notifications

## Guiding Principles

- **Verticality**: scrolling up and down should be the primary interaction the user initiates when navigating throughout the application, and we want to base our IA and signifiers around this principle.
  - Any scales we want to show that can be signified vertically like time
- **Simplicity:** Offering a basic search without an account and offering email authentication for account management means the user can start using the application in no time
- **Cohesion:** Enforcing strict views with customization options only for density means a cohesive experience on all platforms

## Wireframes

I created some basic wireframes and a site map to help me visualize the layout of the application, and to help me plan out the components I would need to create. These designs are iterations of the [alpha version](/works/football-dashboard-alpha) I created last year that I wanted to improve upon.

This is an ongoing project and I will be updating this page as I make progress.
