# Problem Statement

1. Finding appropriate project works to showcase in your portfolio is difficult.
2. Pursuing your own projects to add to your portfolio is a daunting undertaking; just choosing a good project idea alone is a headache.

## The Solution

> Frontier is a platform that facilitates aspiring designers, developers, project managers to advance their skills and careers by providing company curated projects for them to work on.

### Company Curated?

- Frontier collaborates with companies to create project specifications that target their candidate needs
- Candidates completing these projects get a chance to get noticed by the specified company and add to their portfolio of works
- Once a candidate completed a project, they could display their work directly on the platform.

# The Design Process

### Gaining User Understanding

We first needed to gain a better understanding of what our user flow and potential
users would look like.

We created the customer journey maps and storyboards you see below to showcase this
understanding.

{/* <LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 1",
    },
    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap2.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 2",
    },
    {
      title: "CustomerJourneyMap3.jpg",
      caption: "Customer Journey Map Part 3",
    },
    {
      title: "storyboard.jpg",
      caption: "Storyboard",
    },
  ]}
/> */}

We then created user personas to build an understanding of potential users and their needs by
identifying pain points our potential users were facing.

{/* <LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "Joe.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Joe (Part 1)",
    },
    {
      title: "Joe2.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Joe (Part 2)",
    },
    {
      title: "Sandy.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Sandy (Part 2)",
    },
    {
      title: "Sandy2.jpg",
      caption: "User Persona: Sandy (Part 2)",
    },
  ]}
/> */}

To further confirm our audience definition, we created and distributed a customer
survey and performed user interviews.

We asked users questions concerning:

1. Their struggles showcasing their skills and abilities to potential employers
2. What kind of work they were willing to do to showcase these skills
3. anxieties they had in regards to the job hunting process

{/* <LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "usevsjobseeking.png",
      caption: "Likeliness to Use vs. Currently Seeking a Job Bar Chart",
    },
    {
      title: "jobsecurityconcernvsuse.png",
      caption:
        "Correlation Between Job Security Concern and Likelines to Use Bar Chart",
    },
    {
      title: "usevstimeseekingjob.png",
      caption:
        "Likeliness to Use vs Amount of Time Looking for Jobs Line Graph",
    },
    {
      title: "unpaidvsneed.png",
      caption:
        "Willingness to do Unpaid Portfolio Work vs. Need for Portfolio Work Chart",
    },
  ]}
/> */}

> **Our results indicated a promising viability and interest for our product**

Most entry level professionals were willing to put work into guided, unpaid projects
if it meant it gave them a higher chance to be hired.

### Wireframing

low-fidelity wireframes were created to do some preliminary user testing to see how our user flow would perform in action.

{/* <LightboxImage
  images={[
    {
      title: "lofi_Browse_projects.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Browse Projects Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Select_Companies.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Companies Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Select_Professions.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Professions Page",
    },
    {
      title: "lofi_Onboarding_-_Difficulty.png",
      caption: "Low-Fi Wireframe: Select Difficulty Page",
    },
  ]}
/> */}

### Prototyping

After some refinements based on stakeholder feedback, we began working on a higher fidelity
version of our wireframes for user testing, and eventually ended up with a final prototype after iterating on stakeholder feedback.

> **To see a clickable prototype of this web platform, click [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4TBW3F5RK#/screens)**

This prototype is meant to walk the users through the core product experience or primary use case,
from the discovery of the platform to a final project submission.

### User Testing via [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/)

We then performed user testing virtually with this prototype via UserTesting.com, an online user testing platform.

We constrained our pool of users to our target audience of young professionals looking
to or have only recently started their tech careers, and had these 10 users test out our prototype.

Our prototype performed very well exemplified by the metrics and feedback below, establishing quickly user understanding of
the product, with few hiccups as users navigated through our primary use case.
