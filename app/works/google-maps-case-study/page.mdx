# Introduction

## When it comes to Navigation, Google is King üëë

Google Maps has been a navigation and web mapping service that users trust to get them where they need to go for more than a decade.

With more than [1 billion active users](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654454/android-reaches-2-billion-monthly-active-users) and counting,
it far overshadows its competition.

## Endless Data, Powerful AI

Utilizing a [wealth of data available to them](https://www.blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-we-map-world/) to power their navigation experience,
google is able to calculate the **fastest route possible**.

They have the ability to account for live traffic and live traffic speeds from data provided by their users, further optimizing the calculated
fastest route.

## A User Experience built for a Fast-Paced, Modern World

It only takes 3 simple steps to get started on Google Maps.

## Time is Money...

This navigation experience presents two clear gains for users: **it simplifies travel and saves time**.

For all we know that extra time Google Maps trims down by optimizing the route has saved
users from missing that all-important interview or that career defining presentation.

## ...but Speed isn't Everything

Prioritizing speed is clearly useful, but it causes the application to mishandle other important use cases.

The end goal for a user is not always to get somewhere as fast as possible.

Every individual driver is also different in some way; they have distinct driving habits, road preferences, and other external factors
that can impact the route they may want to take.

Here are some examples...

# Alternative Use Cases

---

### 1. Driving Long Distances for Leisure

<LightboxImages

If you're looking to have a fun road trip from Washington D.C to NYC, the fastest route isn't necessarily the best route.

In 2018 as much as 39% of vacations taken by Americans were road trips. [^1] This is bound to be even higher with the current pandemic.

These **travelers would prefer scenic routes or routes with exciting attractions along them**, which may not always be the fastest route.

[^1]: Acccording to [MMGY Global‚Äôs 2017-18 Portrait of American Travelers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/travel/road-trips-in-the-united-states.html)

But the experience with Google Maps on a road trip can end up like this:

1. Two friends üßçüßç are driving from Seattle to San Francisco on a west coast road trip. They have some destinations in mind already like their hotels üè®, national parks üèûÔ∏è, and other attractions that they
could tell google maps to navigate to.

2. When they first embark towards Portland, they simply route Google Maps to their hotel with the standard unmodified route.

3. The drive ends up being boring ü•±, with nothing much to see on the interstate, so the next day they work to modify their route to have more scenery and interesting attractions along the way.

4. Without a clear option within google maps to plan a route for this purpose, their only choice was to search and add each destination manually in Google Maps alongside their desired route.


### 2. Drivers who Prefer Familiar and Easy Driving Routes

This might include the following types of drivers:

- elderly drivers
- inexperienced drivers
- anxious drivers
- drivers in poor road or weather conditions

There are instances in which google maps navigation will further complicate a route for the sake of minimal time saving. Users have made complaints about the over-prioritization of faster routes [^2].

The navigation will prompt the user while they are driving to redirect them to a faster route, even when the amount of time saved is negligible.

**The effort and attention required to take these routes outweigh the time they might save.**

Here are two examples:

[^2]: From this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/bwgmk8/i_found_a_faster_route/).

> "Driver-related factors (i.e., error, impairment, fatigue, and distraction) were present in almost 90% of crashes." [^3]

[^3]: From the [Virginia Tech Transportation Institute report on driving statistics](https://driving-tests.org/driving-statistics//), 2016.


> "...Diverting all cars to a small road to avoid congestion is not the best idea. Yesterday maps diverted me to a road that's almost not usable, very steep and damaged roads, causing our car to overheat and clutch slip, tyre slip and the road was through forest with no helpline or road side assistance or mobile network . Just being fastest is not the point, safety is the 1st priorty." [^4]

### 3. Drivers on Unfamiliar Roads

Driving in unfamiliar settings can throw off any experienced driver, increasing the risks of crashing.

You might come across intersections and roadways that confuse and disorient you, risking the safety of yourself and everyone else on the road.

In fact **being unfamiliar with a vehicle or roadway** increases the risk of crashing by hundreds of times. [^5]

[^5]: From the [Virginia Tech Transportation Institute report on driving statistics](https://driving-tests.org/driving-statistics//), 2016.

If you're in a foreign country, this can be further complicated by differing driving habits, unfamiliar road signs, and untold rules of the road that a foreign driver may not know.

# Approaching the Problems

For each of these scenarios, I brainstormed solutions that could easily be integrated into the current navigation user flow, keeping in mind that minimal distractions are essential to
a safe navigation experience. I made a shortlist of suggested improvements during the ideation process.

## Brainstormed Improvements

- **Allowing users to create road trip itineraries within the app before they start navigating**
- **Offering more route options like simplest/most straightforward route, scenic routes, local roads only, avoiding large intersections, avoiding complicated or confusing routes, etc.**
- **Prompting users with important information when they are navigating in different regions and countries**
- **A new Assistive Driving Mode with simplified routes, step by step audio instructions, and certain route avoidances for unfamiliar routes and high speed/high volume roadways.**
- Offering optional prompts for popular road trip destinations while navigating
- Adapting to previous choices made by users (Automatically choosing a users preferred route when instructions are consistently ignored)
- Using hands free notifications to encourage drivers to take breaks or switch drivers when they are on a long drive (Most authorities on driver safety recommend taking pit stops every 2 hours.)
- Alerts for road situations on unfamiliar roads that can help drivers stay vigilant (narrow road ways, sharp turns, complex intersections, etc.)

## Sketching

For the best ideas that are bolded, I sketched user flows to see how they would fit in to the existing navigation experience.

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    preliminary_sketches_1
  ]}
/>

**Use Case #1: Long Drives**

For this use case, I wanted to create a roadtrip planning experience that maintains the simple and easy navigation experience Google Maps offers.

I give users basic options for their chosen route and small planning features that bridge the gap between the typical navigation experience on Google Maps and this use case, **without drawing out too much complexity**.

---

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    preliminary_sketches_3
  ]}
/>

**Use Case #2: Drivers who will prefer easier, less complicated driving routes**

Adding an assistive driving mode option gives users the choice to enhance their navigation experience with more feedback and more simplified
route options. This mode will be easily toggleable and enables:

- Avoiding highways and other high volume traffic routes
- Prioritizing simplest routes (least amount of turning, turns with turn signals only)
- More audio instructions (e.g. Prepare to turn left in 5 miles at St. John Street)
- Prioritizes routes that a user often drives along

This option is intended to help drivers avoid stressful situations, prioritizing comfort and safety over speed.

---

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    preliminary_sketches_2
  ]}
/>

**Use Case #3: Drivers on Unfamiliar Roads**

Informational cards and audio prompts appear when drivers are in unfamiliar surroundings like a new country or region to prepare them for the road ahead.

# Wireframes and Prototyping

After gathering some feedback on these initial sketches from Google Maps users, I created a prototype to further test these ideas,
taking into account the usability and user understanding of what each case is intended to accomplish.

> **For the full prototype experience, click the link [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/ed71df57-f258-4f17-63fd-6f050c921385-9b40/).**

I also provide a preview of the final prototype screens for each use case with a written walkthrough of the use cases, and their possible shortcomings.

## Case 1: Creating a Lightweight Road Trip Itinerary

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    Google_Maps_Mockup_Case_1
  ]}
/>

### User Flow

1. Input a destination that is considered a long drive that would require stopping.
2. Choose from multiple routes available that take into account scenery and attractions along the way.
3. Add suggested stops along the route to plan out a few destinations.
4. Modify the route to their desire.

### Shortcomings

Considering the existing products Google has pertaining to navigation and travel (like [Google Travel](https://www.google.com/travel/)), a road trip
a trip planning experience within the app seems like a natural fit, but integrating it directly into Google Maps could create a bloated app experience.

## Case 2: Assisted Driving Mode

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    Google_Maps_Mockup_Case_2
  ]}
/>

### User Flow

1. An Assisted Driving Mode toggle would be added to the bottom drawer before a user starts up navigation.
2. This mode simplifies driving routes and adds more informative prompts to help the user navigate more thoroughly.

It's essentialy a training wheels version of the default navigation experience to anyone who might need it.

### Shortcomings

With route options well hidden inside the kebab menu, offering a more upfront and easily enabled solution seemed appropriate
considering the demographics of people who might use this feature.

But it could confuse existing users when they use the app, and the name of the feature itself doesn't do well in explaining it's intended purpose.

## Case 3: Drivers in Unfamiliar Surroundings

<LightboxImages
  images={[
    Google_Maps_Mockup_Case_3
  ]}
/>

### User Flow

1. Location based prompts would appear for any drivers starting up the navigation experience in a foreign country, giving them some heads up about driving practices in that
country if needed.

2. Other navigation prompts would also appear that specify unfamiliar road conditions or allow route simplification options, either before or during
navigation.

### Shortcomings

What is to be considered a "simplified" route may not hold the same definition for every user.

# Reflection

This case study was exploratory. Many of the issues I bring to light in this case study are usability issues that I have either experienced myself or have had others
express frustrations about.

I wanted to investigate these issues and brainstorm solutions, both large and small scale, that would improve the overall user experience of the app.
